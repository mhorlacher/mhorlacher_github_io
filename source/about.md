I'm a first-year Bioinformatics PhD Student at the Institute of Computation Biology (ICB) at HMGU in Munich.

My professional research revolves around in-silico analysis of RNA-binding proteins using Deep Learning models.
I have a passion for software developement, data analysis and data visualization. Besides, I like to work on a number of
side projects for personal enjoyment and to teach myself new skills.

This small blog servers as a minimalistic knowledge-base, primarily for myself, to summarize useful tips and tricks
for data analysis.

If you want to learn more about me and my work, check out my LinkedIn or Github page, or feel free to write a mail to [marc.horlacher[at]gmail.com]().
